##How does Laravel handle routing and URL mapping?

This was the question I asked myself. 
To resolve this question I created a simple Laravel project and started to investigate the laravel routing documentation:
https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/routing


In this project you will find the code to the most of the examples in the documentation.
